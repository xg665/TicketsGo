## Overview

(___TODO__: a brief one or two paragraph, high-level description of your project_)

TicketAround is a ticket recommendation site that recommends tickets/events within 25mi,50mi and 75mi radius of user's Geolocations(More sophisticated recommedation may be implemented if time permits). 

It is a webapp that allows users to browse nearby events on a google map and browse favorited events once logged in. For every event selected by users, they can click on the event and be redirected to ticketmaster.com to make purchases.  


## Data Model

* items have item_id, name, address, category, image_url,url
* users have user_id,username,password hash, email
* favorites have user_id(as reference), multiple items(by reference) 

(___TODO__: sample documents_)

  item_id://autogenerated id
  name:
